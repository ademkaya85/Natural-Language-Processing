# Natural-Language-Processing

## Overview

The application scrapes artists' lyrics from a website and save them locally.
It builds a model that can predict the artist given some song lyrics. We make it into a python program that a user can interact with.

## Implementation of the method

Two artists Random-Chance and Random-Axe are chosen. Their lyrics are scraped from '*https://www.lyrics.com*'. After some featue enginnering, *MultinomialNB* is trained.
